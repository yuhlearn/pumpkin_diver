# pumpkin-diver
Spigot plugin that allows players to breathe longer underwater when a carved pumpkin is worn as helmet

# Usage
Use carved pumpkin as helmet and you will be allowed to breathe longer underwater. When you run out of air, the pumpkin will break and you will start drowning. Air can be regained like normal, as long as the pumpkin is intact.

# Commands
`/pumpkindiver [0-9]` sets how much to slow down air decay, where higher is slower and 0 disables the effect of the plugin.
